/**
 * Posts a release to a Discord webhook, written for Mod My Android's #app-updates channel.
 *
 *   node tools/announce-release.mjs --dry-run    # print the message, send nothing
 *   node tools/announce-release.mjs             # read $GITHUB_EVENT_PATH and post it
 *
 * The shape follows what that channel already looks like rather than what a webhook can do. Niagara, Nova and Smart
 * Launcher all post a plain message: the app and version on the first line, a short account of each change, then a
 * download link. No embed cards, so this does not either.
 *
 * Environment:
 *   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL   required to actually send. One webhook, or several separated by commas: Folio's own
 *                         server should not hear about a release after everyone else. Without it this prints and
 *                         exits 0, so a fork never fails.
 *   DISCORD_ROLE_ID       optional. The role to ping on the first line, one per webhook in the same order, since a
 *                         role only exists in its own server. Leave a position empty for no ping there:
 *                         ",1553093586705449062" pings nobody in the first server and that role in the second.
 *   ANNOUNCE_PRERELEASES  "true" to post betas as well. Off by default: a beta a week is how a channel gets muted.
 *
 * No APK is attached. Discord's upload limit is below a release build, and the file should come from GitHub, where
 * its checksum and signing certificate sit beside it.
