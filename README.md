## Why I made this

Honestly, I started this for fun. I've spent the last few months building an iPhone app, then I got a Galaxy Z Fold8
and got excited by how much Android lets you customize. At the same time I felt a little homesick for Apple, or at
least for the jailbreak features I loved. I've been in the iOS jailbreak world since iOS 7 or 8, so this was me getting
back into it.

The hardest part was learning Android: how permissions work and how launchers work. I got the hang of it. Anything
that came from someone else, or that inspired me, is credited [below](#credits). (Since I'm the only tester for now,
AI helps with bug testing.)

I want to give back to the open-source community, so Folio is free and open source.

## Who it's for

Anyone who wants a clean look, likes the Apple style without Apple's restrictions, or just wants their phone to work
the way *they* want. I'm building what I knew I couldn't have on iPhone.

I found jailbreaking in middle school and loved it. iOS keeps getting more locked down, so I moved to something more
open (for now, until Google locks theirs down too). I also have an app in testing on the App Store, and that alone was
a three-month process, so I'll do what it takes to make what I want.

**Have an idea? Tell me!** If you want to help build Folio, [let me know](#get-involved).

## A few of my favorite parts

Some of my favorite days on my phone were spent with tweaks like Barrel, just making the phone my own. Folio is my
way of bringing that back:

- **Badges that match the app.** Badges can take the color of each app's icon, like the ColorBadges tweak. It was more
  complex than I expected, but it's neat, so check it out (Settings › Icons & Side Bar › Badge color).
- **iPhone-style appearance.** Choose default, dark or tinted icons, notification badges, wallpaper and glass effects
  directly in Settings.
- **The iPhone Duo Side Bar.** The status bar, Dynamic Island and dock live on the right edge. Thanks to
  [DuoLauncher](https://github.com/jakesgoodapps/DuoLauncher), whose dev made it possible for me to build on top of their work.
- **Left-handed mode and Spotlight.** Flip the Side Bar to the left, and search everything from Spotlight.
- **Page Effects,** inspired by Barrel, are available in Settings › Gestures & Actions.

There's a lot to this launcher, and it's fun. I hope you have as much fun with it as I've had making it.

## What it does

**Adapts to the screen, doesn't just stretch**
- Lays out by how much room there is, not what device it is: phones, flips, foldables, split-screen, tablets.
- Open the Fold and you get two Home pages side by side. Portrait unfolded gets one centered page with a dock bar. The cover in landscape gets two columns.
- Knows where the fold is: when the phone is half folded, sheets, menus and Home rows move off the crease.
- Bigger screens draw everything bigger, like iPad, instead of a tiny phone layout in the middle.

**The iOS stuff**
- Side Bar with the status bar, a Dynamic Island that wraps the camera, and the dock.
- Notification Center, Control Center, Spotlight, Today View, Smart Stacks and the widget gallery.
- Jiggle mode, folders, Icon Stacks, per-page icon size and labels, and App Library search.
- Clear Badge from an app's long-press menu.
- Focus modes with schedules and the Home pages you want to see.
- Download rings on updating apps, blue dots on new ones, and Add to Home Screen for shortcuts and websites.
- Settings built like iOS: menus with checkmarks, segmented controls, switches, sheets and alerts.

**Appearance and app controls**
- Default, dark and tinted icons, glass effects, notification badges and wallpaper controls.
- Pick an app icon (Teal, Soft or Olive), and live Clock and Calendar icons that match your other icons.
- App icon panels and dock magnification are direct switches in Home Screen & Dock.
- Notification app rows and app-colored notifications are in Notifications & Control Center.
- Album-art colors for media are in Dynamic Island settings.

**Layout tools (off until you turn them on)**
- Layout History: saves Home before big changes so you can go back.
- Recent App Dots: a dot beside dock apps you used in the last hour.

**Private**
- No accounts, no ads, no analytics. Crash reports stay on your phone unless you share them.
  Google search, Discover and widgets from other apps use those apps' own services. Every permission is optional and
  explained where it's used. Every permission is listed in [PERMISSIONS.md](PERMISSIONS.md), with what happens if you
  say no; more about data in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## What you need

- Android 12 or newer. No root.
- Made on a Galaxy Z Fold, but it's meant to work on any Android phone, flip, tablet or Chromebook.

| Device | Android | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Samsung Galaxy Z Fold8 (SM-F971U), cover and inner screens | 17 (One UI 9) | Used for development and testing |
| Other phones, flips, tablets, Chromebooks | 12+ | Layout unit-tested on Android Studio's device sizes, not yet on real hardware. [Tell me how it goes!](https://github.com/McCal-Codes/folio/issues/new/choose) |

### Known limitations

Android doesn't allow everything iOS does, so a few things work differently:

- **Lock screen:** Folio can't replace Android's lock screen. The Lock Cover shows after you unlock.
- **Status Bar in other apps:** Android doesn't let an app reserve space inside other apps, so the Side Bar status stays on Home. The Dynamic Island and dock can float over other apps with the gestures service.
- **Pull-down panels:** opening Notification Center and Control Center from the top corners needs Folio's accessibility (gestures) service.
- **Folding from Home on Samsung:** set Settings › Display › Continue apps on cover screen to Always, or the phone locks when you fold.
- **Google Discover** needs the Google app and depends on your phone supporting it.

## Install

Install an APK built from this project, then press Home and pick Folio, or open Folio and tap **Set as home app**.
Use the same signing key for subsequent builds to install them over the existing app.

## Build it

```bash
JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17 ./gradlew :app:assembleFast
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/fast/app-fast.apk
```

`assembleFast` is the optimized build I use day to day. `:app:assembleDebug` works too (APK in
`app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`). After installing, press Home and pick Folio, or open Folio Settings and tap
**Set as home app**.

Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`

## FAQ

**Does it need root?** No. Folio is a normal Android launcher.

**Why does it ask for so many permissions?** It doesn't need most of them. Only being your Home app is required. The
rest are optional and asked for where they're used, like notification access for the Dynamic Island, or the gestures
service for pull-down panels. Every permission is listed with what it's for in Settings › Privacy & Permissions, in
[PERMISSIONS.md](PERMISSIONS.md) (all 14, with what breaks if you say no) and in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

**Does Folio send my data anywhere?** No accounts, ads or analytics. Crash reports stay on your phone unless you
share one. Google search, Discover and third-party widgets use their own services.

**How do I go back to my old launcher?** Settings › Apps › Default apps › Home app on your phone (the exact path can
vary by phone). Your Folio layout stays saved if you switch back later.

**Something broke. What do I do?** Settings › Help › Report a Bug in Folio opens the bug form with your details filled
in. If Folio crashes a few times in a row, it opens in Safe Mode with optional features paused. More in
[troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md).

- **[iphone-duo](https://github.com/chuspeeism/iphone-duo)** by chuspeeism (MIT): the blur/darkening curves and hinge-angle model that Folio's fold shader follows.
- **u/moomanjohnny** on r/GalaxyFold: the Galaxy Z Fold 8 proof of concept that showed screenshots + shaders + hinge sensors can recreate the iPhone Duo unfold; inspired Folio's screenshot-morph fold style. No code was released or used.
- **[ZFoldDuo](https://github.com/nnnnnnn0090/Z-Fold-Duo-TEST)** by nnnnnnn0090 (MIT): showed that a Galaxy Z Fold7/Fold8 can read Samsung's internal hinge angle on the phone itself, without root, using Wireless Debugging. Research for Enhanced Fold Tracking, which is being explored; no ZFoldDuo code is in Folio yet.
- **FoldFX** by u/FixHour8452 on r/GalaxyFold: ideas for the fold transition (a haptic tick halfway, a light sweep, a slight scale, and following a smooth hinge angle where the phone reports one). Re-created from scratch; no code was used.
- **[QuickLaunch](https://github.com/AhmedTheGeek/QuickLaunch)** by AhmedTheGeek (GPL-3.0): ideas for Spotlight, namely requesting the keyboard after the first frame, frecency ranking with a 7-day half-life, and drag-to-split-screen. Re-implemented independently; no QuickLaunch code is included.
- **iOS jailbreak tweaks** (ideas only, re-created from scratch; no code): Velox by Phillip Tennen (app panels), Activator by Ryan Petrich (gesture and event actions), Axon by Nepeta (notification app row), Velvet by NoisyFlake & HiMyNameisUbik (tinted notifications), ColorFlow by David Goldman (album-art colors), Harbor by Evan Swick (dock magnification), SnowBoard by SparkDev (themes), Apex by Sticktron (Icon Stacks), Icon Restore (Layout History), Lynx 2 (recent-app dots), ColorBadges (badges that match the app) and Barrel (Page Effects, coming soon).
